<h3>A plugin for using the Centaur Mailroom Management System training</h3>
This plugin can connect with your Centaur application. When it is first installed it will default to loading the Centaur demonstration system. When you signed up to the Centaur
service with Laberg you would have been given a URL that is used through the browser in order to record transactions. IoTKeys needs to load that URL. For more details see the 
  Centaur plugin
