<h3>A plugin for using the Centaur Mailroom Management System</h3>
This plugin can connect with weighing and cubing devices. When it is first installed it will default to loading the Centaur demonstration system. When you signed up to the Centaur
service with Laberg you would have been given a URL that is used through the browser in order to record transactions. IoTKeys needs to load that URL.
<br/>
For example, if you go to;
<br/>
http://myUni.laberg.com.au/common/foxisapi.dll/intracargo.x2.login
<br/>
in order to process transactions, then that URL needs to be entered into the file urlMaps.json.
<br/>
Go to the directory where IoTKeys was installed and search for the file urlMaps.json. Look for the line;
<b>"initialURL": "http://demo.laberg.com.au/common/foxisapi.dll/intracargo.x2.login",</b>
<br/>
and change it to
<br/>
"initialURL": "http://myUni.laberg.com.au/common/foxisapi.dll/intracargo.x2.login",
<br/>
Save the file and start IoTKeys.
