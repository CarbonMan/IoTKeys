<h3>A plugin to making Australia Post shipments</h3>
This plugin can connect with order plugins, weighing and cubing devices and an inventory system. The diagram below shows the process but it is really simple.
  <ol>
  <li>The Australia Post login screen will be brought up</li>
  <li>Log in (don't worry NONE of the processing happens on our servers)</li>
  <li>Enter a reference number (ie. an eBay order number)</li>
  <li>If order plugins are detected they are queried for the reference number</li>
  <li>The order plugin returns the receiver details and they are pushed into the booking</li>
  <li>If devices are detected they are queried for values. Weighing scales and cubing machines are handled.</li>
  <li>The device result are pushed into the booking</li>
  <li>You accept the booking</li>
  <li>If an inventory plugin is detected the order skus and quantities are passed in</li>
  <li>The inventory system can adjust the stock levels</li>
  </ol>
