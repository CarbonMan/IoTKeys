<h3>Arena host</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
  An arena is the Access Point for a private network of devices.
<br>
<h4>CONFIGURATION</h4>
The configuration details are found in the file<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>devices.json</li>
  </ol>
  This is described below. If, for any reason, changes are made in this file then the contents should be validated here;<br/>
  https://jsonlint.com/
  <br/>
  If the structure of the file is invalid then the application may not start correctly.<br/>
  <h4>devices.json</h4>
Usually the only value that should be changed is the <b>portName</b>. If set to "?" then this will cause IoTKeys to scan the ports on startup. 
This may not work in all cases. In situations where the scan detects the wrong USB device then the correct port needs to be entered into this file. If the device is moved to 
another port then it will have to be reentered.
To set the COM port first you have to determine the port number.
On Windows 8/10 right click the start button

The following screen will be loaded

<br/><br/>
The COM port is indicated in the (). So in this case it is "COM4". The portName line in the devices.json file would be: 
<br/>
  ...
  <br/>
  "portName" : "COM4",
  <br/>
  ...
  <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
  If the Arena device is shown in the Ports with a warning, that will usually indicate that a device driver needs to be installed. You will need to obtain administrative privileges from your network or IT administrator in order to install these drivers.
  The driver can be found here
