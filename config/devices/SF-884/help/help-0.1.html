<h3>SF-884 is an scales indicator</h3>

<h4>CONFIGURATION</h4>
The configuration details are found in the file devices.json
Usually the only value that should be changed is the <b>portName</b>. If set to "?" then this will cause IoTKeys to scan the ports on startup. 
This may not work in all cases. In situations where the scan detects the wrong USB device then the correct port needs to be entered into this file. If the device is moved to 
another port then it will have to be reentered.
To set the COM port first you have to determine the port number.
On Windows 8/10 right click the start button
